## _khamma Ghani !!_


It was my first-time experience being part of Sprint after my joining. I am very grateful to the organizer for conducting this kind of program.


## Getting to Know My Teammates Better

First, we arranged a team bonding session __'A day in the life of everyone'__. In this session, all team members describe their whole day in brief. From this session, I was able to discover each other's strengths and skills. It creates a friendly and inclusive atmosphere.

## Working of Avni

It was arranged by a senior team member. They gave a brief understanding of the Product and other tools and technology we used. It was a good and very informative session and helped me to understand.

## Field Visit

I visited ngo called __Aajeevika Bureau__ with my fellow teammates. It was my first-time experience knowing how NGOs are working at the ground level.

## Fun Activities and Place Visit

From the start to the end of the sprint session, we had some fun activities. It gives a lot of joy and happiness. As We are coming from different states and different cultures, It gives respect, empathy, and sensitivity toward others.
